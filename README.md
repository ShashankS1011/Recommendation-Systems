# Collaborative Filtering with BERT Fine-Tuned Using ALS  

This repository presents a hybrid recommendation system that combines **Collaborative Filtering** with **BERT** embeddings and fine-tunes the model using **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**. The approach bridges user-item interaction data with semantic insights from text to deliver personalized and context-aware recommendations.  

---

## Repository Structure  

- **Dataset/**  
  Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed (if necessary) before use.  

- **Code/**  
  Includes the `.ipynb` file implementing the hybrid recommendation system.  

---

## Features  

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Models user-item relationships using interaction data.  
2. **BERT Integration**: Extracts semantic embeddings from textual features for content-aware recommendations.  
3. **ALS Fine-Tuning**: Optimizes the collaborative filtering model for better accuracy and scalability.  
4. **Hybrid System**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for robust recommendations.  

---

## Workflow  

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Load and preprocess user-item interaction data and textual content (if applicable).  
   - Ensure the dataset is placed in the `Dataset/` folder.  

2. **Collaborative Filtering**  
   - Use Collaborative Filtering to model user-item interactions.  

3. **BERT Integration**  
   - Generate semantic embeddings from textual data using BERT.  

4. **ALS Optimization**  
   - Fine-tune the collaborative model with ALS to achieve optimal results.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Assess the model’s performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE or Precision@K.

## Prerequisites  

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:  
- Python 3.7+  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (for BERT)  
- Spark / MLlib (for ALS optimization)  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (for data processing and evaluation)
